# angular & testing-library example

A simple showcase how to integrate [testing-library](https://testing-library.com/) into an [Angular](https://angular.io/) application.

I used following links for research how to build this showcase:

* [Integrate Jest into an Angular application and library](https://timdeschryver.dev/blog/integrate-jest-into-an-angular-application-and-library#creating-the-library)
* [Setting Up Jest in Angular](https://dev.to/elsieej/setting-up-jest-in-angular-hbe)
* [Testing Angular Component using Jest](https://www.devcurry.com/2020/09/testing-angular-component-using-jest.html)
* [Angular Testing Library (official)](https://testing-library.com/docs/angular-testing-library/intro/)
* [@testing-library/angular samples (official)](https://github.com/testing-library/angular-testing-library)
